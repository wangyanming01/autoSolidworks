## REPOSITORY ARCHITECTURE

mcp-server-solidworks (public name: **SolidPilot**) is an AI-driven CAD automation system for SolidWorks.

The defining idea: the AI works at the **CAD feature level**, not the tool level. The host model expresses *intent* as a CAD-neutral **Feature Graph IR**; a deterministic compiler lowers that IR into concrete SolidWorks operations. This solves the core economic problem — the SolidWorks API has thousands of methods, and exposing each as a flat tool explodes context size and token cost.

**MCP sits at the TOP** — it is the boundary where the AI host meets the system, exposing the feature-level interface. Everything **below** the IR is deterministic internal machinery reached over plain REST; MCP is never used as an internal transport.

## LAYERS

### 1. cad-planner (CAD-neutral) — AI Planning / Intent Layer
Converts user intent into a CAD-neutral **Feature Graph IR**. Operates at the feature level, never the tool level.
- **Phase 1:** realized as the host model (Claude) + the IR schema + a planning prompt. No separate service.
- **Phase 2:** optional dedicated/local-LLM planner for near-zero cost. Same IR contract.
- Validates **structure** only (types, params, node references). NOT geometry.
- Does NOT touch SolidWorks, does NOT execute, does NOT emit raw tool sequences.

### 2. compiler/solidworks (SolidWorks-specific) — Deterministic CAD Compiler
Lowers the IR into ordered execution-layer tool calls. **Deterministic — no LLM, no MCP.**
- **Reference Resolver:** resolves semantic refs (`top_face`, `center`) to concrete selectors/coords against live B-rep state — the hardest, make-or-break module.
- Performs **geometric** validation (face exists, fit, selector uniqueness).
- Maps low-level failures back up to feature-level errors so recovery isn't lost.
- A different CAD backend = a different compiler; the IR and cad-planner stay unchanged.

### 3. execution/solidworks (SolidWorks-specific) — Execution Layer / Truth Engine
C# .NET 4.8 REST + COM. The **only** layer allowed to touch SolidWorks COM. Deterministic execution, authoritative CAD state, idempotency + `state_version`. NO AI, NO planning. Adapter- and compiler-agnostic.

### 4. adapters/* — MCP Protocol Bridge
Exposes the system to a specific AI host over MCP.
- **Target:** one high-level tool `submit_feature_graph(graph)` (+ a few reads).
- **Phase 1:** still exposes the low-level tools directly (38 today) so the working path runs while the IR vocabulary grows; they collapse into the IR tool once the vocabulary and resolver are ready.
- `adapters/claude/` is the current implementation. Additional adapters reuse a shared bridge core.

## CONTRACTS

| Contract | Location | Owner | Nature |
|---|---|---|---|
| `feature-graph.schema.json` | `cad-planner/contracts/` | Planner | CAD-NEUTRAL IR **+ capability registry** (single artifact) |
| `tool-schemas.json` | `execution/solidworks/contracts/` | Execution | SolidWorks low-level tool surface |
| `state-format.json` | `execution/solidworks/contracts/` | Execution | CadState structure |
| `execution-response.json` | `execution/solidworks/contracts/` | Execution | COMPLETED / FAILED / DUPLICATE |

The capability registry **is** the IR schema — the Planner validates intent against that one file; there is no separate discovery protocol.

---

## VALIDATION SPLIT (DECIDED)

- **Plan-time (Planner / IR schema):** structural + schema validation only — registered types, required params present, node references structurally resolvable, units correct.
- **Compile/exec-time (Compiler + Resolver + Execution):** geometric validity — referenced face actually exists, hole fits, selector resolves to exactly one entity.

The Planner cannot validate geometry; it has no live B-rep state. Do not conflate the two.

---

## ARCHITECTURAL INVARIANTS

- The AI works at feature level; only the compiler knows tools; only execution knows COM.
- MCP is the **top** boundary (host ↔ IR), never an internal transport.
- The IR is **CAD-neutral**; SolidWorks specifics live only in compiler + execution. Backend-specific params use an explicit `backend_ext` escape hatch.
- Execution and Planner have zero knowledge of which adapter/host is calling.
- Adding a CAD backend = new compiler + execution; the IR and cad-planner are unchanged.
- The compiler is the "second planner" — but **deterministic**. What we forbid is a second *LLM* re-doing the host's reasoning.

---

## DESIGN GOALS

- Deterministic, reproducible CAD execution.
- Low token cost: one LLM call (intent → IR) per request; everything below is deterministic.
- AI-model-agnostic and (eventually) CAD-system-agnostic.
- Strict separation of intent vs implementation.

> **Build discipline:** the IR vocabulary and reference model are DRAFT and must be **derived from real production designs, not invented ahead of them.** See the [README](README.md) for the current status and roadmap.
