"""ExecutionPort — the ONLY way pycompiler reaches the execution layer.

This is the separability boundary (IR-ADR-003): the compiler depends on this small interface,
never on the adapter, the MCP SDK, or httpx. A concrete implementation lives OUTSIDE pycompiler
(today: adapters/claude/ir_execution_port.py, which delegates to the existing execution_client
over plain REST). Moving the compiler into a standalone REST service later is just a different
ExecutionPort behind the same calls — the lowering / resolver / validation logic is untouched.

        robustness (e.g. one resync+retry on INVALID_STATE_VERSION) and MUST return the final

      get_state() -> int: the authoritative current state_version (GET /state — read-only, no
        check, no increment). Used to seed a run and to resync afterwards.
