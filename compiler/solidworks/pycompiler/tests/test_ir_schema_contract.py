"""Contract test (audit-A1): the IR schema (cad-planner) vs the validator (pycompiler).

Guards against drift between the CAD-neutral capability registry at
`cad-planner/contracts/feature-graph.schema.json` (its `covered_subset` block) and the
frozensets in `pycompiler/ir_schema.py` that actually decide what compiles. The schema IS the
capability registry (ADR-005): if it advertises a token the validator rejects, an author writes a
graph that cannot build; if the validator accepts a token the schema never advertises, the
capability is invisible. Either direction is a bug, so every pair below is checked BOTH ways with
exact set equality.

Scope — CONTRACT vs PROSE (decided 2026-07-17 with the user):
  CONTRACT = every ARRAY in `covered_subset`; each is a closed set of vocabulary tokens and maps
      to exactly one frozenset. v0.7.1 promoted eight sets that had lived only in prose (the
      assembly vocabulary, pattern directions, chamfer types, bend/flange positions) plus the two
      grammar sets (body/feature producers) into arrays for this purpose — prose cannot be
      tested, and circular_pattern's seed list had silently rotted to five stale types to prove
      it.
  PROSE  = `_note` / `_grammar_note` / `datum_offset` / `assumptions`, and every per-param
      description elsewhere in the schema ("number - meters (> 0)"). Per-param presence, types
      and ranges live in ir_schema.py code and are exercised by test_compiler.py; string-parsing
      them here would be brittle for no gain. This mirrors the scope note the adapter's
      test_schema_contract.py makes for itself.

Run two ways:
  - standalone:  python -m pycompiler.tests.test_ir_schema_contract   (exits non-zero on drift)
  - pytest:      pytest compiler/solidworks/pycompiler/tests/test_ir_schema_contract.py
